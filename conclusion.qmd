# Conclusion


The English league is, in fact, highly competitive. We observed this by analyzing team rotation in the Premier League over the past 25 years. Among the clubs that were part of the Premier League in the 2024-2025 season, only the top nine had been consistently present throughout the seasons since 2000; the remaining teams joined at different points in time. Although these clubs are not typically found at the top of the standings, there are notable exceptions such as Manchester City, which ranked 18th in 2000 and has steadily climbed the table, reaching first place in 2025. 
Despite only a few teams have dominated Premier League titles in recent years, the English promotion system allows for seasons full of surprises such as Blackbrn Rovers winning the 1994-1995 championship after 81 years without a title in English football.

We observed that teams can be classified into those with the most victories and goals, those with the best fair-play performance, and those still striving to obtain better results in the league. The first group includes Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, and Liverpool, with Tottenham just some steps behind. However, some of these clubs tend to be more aggressive and receive more cards per match; only Liverpool, Tottenham, and Manchester City show a consistently cleaner style of play. Among the teams that typically occupy the lower positions in the table are Everton, Newcastle, Aston Villa, West Ham, Fulham, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Leicester, Wolves, Southampton, Bournemouth, Brentford, and Ipswich. The first six of these teams tend to commit more fouls and receive more cards than the remaining teams on the list.

The game itself has also become more competitive. The score margins of the matches are now narrower than before, and the traditional home-field advantage has diminished; we now observe more away wins, more goals scored by visiting teams, and a downward trend in draws.
We also found that the game has become cleaner: fouls have decreased over time, while yellow cards have increased. These behaviors reflect stricter rules and more punishments for infractions. This trend is influenced by the increased use of technology in football – players can no longer risk committing the kinds of fouls that once went unnoticed. Red cards have also decreased, suggesting that the fouls committed today are, in general, less severe and are more likely to warrant only a caution.

We would like to extend this analysis to other leagues and compare our findings for the English league with key performance indicators from football competitions in other countries. There are many ways to further enrich the analysis presented here. Developing a predictive model for the next world champion would be an exciting way to expand and conclude this work. We will continue working on it.
