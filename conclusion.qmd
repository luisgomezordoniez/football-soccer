# Conclusion


The English league is, in fact, highly competitive. We observed this by analyzing team rotation in the Premier League over the past 25 years, which allows second-tier teams to play in the Premier League if they conquer their own league. Among the clubs that were part of the Premier League in the 2024-2025 season, only the top nine had been consistently present throughout the seasons since 2000; the remaining teams joined at different points in time. Although these clubs are not typically found at the top of the standings, there are notable exceptions such as Manchester City, which ranked 18th in 2000 and has steadily climbed the table, reaching first place in 2025. 

The largest part of the competitiveness in English football is mostly observed among teams that rank in the middle and lower positions in the standings table, and despite only a few teams having dominated Premier League titles in recent years, the English promotion system allows for seasons full of surprises, such as Blackburn Rovers winning the 1994-1995 championship after 81 years without a title in English football. The game itself has also become more competitive. The score margins of the matches are now narrower than before, and the traditional home-field advantage has diminished; we now observe more away wins, more goals scored by visiting teams, and a downward trend in draws.

We observed that teams can be classified into three categories: those with the most victories and goals, those with the best fair-play performance, and those still striving to achieve better results in the league. The first group includes Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City, and Liverpool, with Tottenham just some steps behind. However, some of these clubs tend to be more aggressive and receive more cards per match; only Liverpool, Tottenham, and Manchester City consistently display a cleaner style of play. Among the teams that typically occupy the lower positions in the table are Everton, Newcastle, Aston Villa, West Ham, Fulham, Brighton, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Leicester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Southampton, Bournemouth, Brentford, and Ipswich. The first six of these teams tend to commit more fouls and receive more cards than the remaining teams on the list.

We also found that the game has become cleaner: fouls have decreased over time, while the number of yellow cards has increased. These behaviors reflect the fact that there is more scrutiny due to the presence of better-resolution cameras and the VAR (Video Assistant Referee), which may have the effect of making players more cautious when applying a tackle or marking an opponent. Players can no longer take uncontrolled risks, committing the kind of fouls that once were unnoticed. Red cards have also decreased, suggesting that the fouls committed today are, in general, less severe and are more likely to warrant only a caution.

It would be interesting to extend this analysis to other leagues to compare our findings and draw broader, more statistically significant conclusions. There are many ways to further enrich the analysis presented here. Developing a predictive model for the next world champion would be an exciting way to expand and conclude this work. We will continue working on it.
