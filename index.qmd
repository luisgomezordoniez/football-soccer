# Introduction

The history of football dates back to the 19th century, specifically to 1863 with the creation of the Football Association in London, in an effort by English teams to establish clear rules for playing this sport. However, the history of football extends much further, as there are records of various ball games in different cultures such as Chinese, Japanese, Greek, and Mesoamerican, dating back thousands of years. Could it be, then, that humans have an inherent need to kick a ball? Kicking may well be an instinct, but it is also true that football satisfies a series of social needs such as tribalism, competition, cooperation, and entertainment. This is one of the main reasons why football (or soccer, in some countries) is one of the sports with the largest number of followers and with the highest revenues.

In recent years, the collection of football-related data has multiplied, providing us with the opportunity to analyze football and understand it in depth. As the next World Cup approaches, the need to immerse ourselves in football becomes increasingly present. 

English league is known as one of the most competitive in the world for several reasons. The equitable distribution of television revenues and foreign investment help establish a level playing field among clubs, allowing them to sign highly qualified players and build squads capable of competing for promotion to the Premier League and for top positions in the standings. This is why we decided to conduct an analysis of the most representative aspects of football by choosing the English league as it not only brings together highly talented players but also motivates all teams to strive in order to become part of the select group of the best teams in English football, and in the world.

This project aims to analyze the evolution of the most representative aspects of the English league over the years, in terms of attack and defense. Our hypothesis is that the English football is not only theoretically competitive but that the game has become more competitive in practice. We will examine this through key match indicators including goals scored, shots on target, league standings, home versus away performance, refereeing decisions, and card intensity across Premier League matches.
