# Introduction

The history of football dates back to the 19th century, specifically to 1863, with the creation of the Football Association in London, in an effort by English teams to establish clear rules for playing this sport. However, the history of football extends much further, as records of various ball games in different cultures, including Chinese, Japanese, Greek, and Mesoamerican, date back thousands of years. Could humans have an inherent need to kick a ball? Kicking may well be an instinct, but it is also true that football satisfies a range of social needs, including tribalism, competition, cooperation, and entertainment. This is one of the primary reasons why football (or soccer, in some countries) is one of the sports with the most significant number of followers and the highest revenues.

In recent years, the collection of football-related data has increased, providing us with the opportunity to analyze the game in depth and gain a deeper understanding of it. As the next World Cup approaches, the need to immerse ourselves in football becomes increasingly present. 

The English league is known as one of the most competitive in the world for several reasons. The equitable distribution of television revenues and foreign investment helps establish a level playing field among clubs, allowing them to sign highly qualified players and build squads capable of competing for promotion to the Premier League and for top positions in the standings. This is why we decided to analyze the most representative aspects of football by choosing the English league, as it not only brings together highly talented players but also motivates all teams to strive to become part of the select group of the best teams in English football and globally.

This project aims to analyze the evolution of the most representative aspects of the English league over the years, in terms of attack and defense. We hypothesize that English football is not only theoretically competitive but also has become more competitive in practice. We will examine this through key match indicators, including goals scored, shots on target, league standings, home versus away performance, refereeing decisions, and card intensity across Premier League matches.
