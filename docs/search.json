    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe history of football dates back to the 19th century, specifically to 1863 with the creation of the Football Association in London, in an effort by English teams to establish clear rules for playing this sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCreo que no debemos irnos tan atras, tal vez explicar que estamos analizando el futbol inglés porque ahí se creó la primera asociación? Le puse de nombre al proyecto The Beautiful Game, ¿te parece bien conservarlo o tal vez sacar un nombre de la introducción?\n\n\nHowever, the history of football extends much further, as there are records of various ball games in different cultures such as Chinese, Japanese, Greek, and Mesoamerican, dating back thousands of years. Could it be, then, that humans have an inherent need to kick a ball? Kicking may well be an instinct, but it is also true that football satisfies a series of social needs such as tribalism, competition, cooperation, and entertainment.\nIn recent years, the collection of football-related data has multiplied, providing us with the opportunity to analyze football and understand it in depth. As the next World Cup approaches, the need to immerse ourselves in football becomes increasingly present. This is why we decided to conduct an analysis of the most representative aspects of football by choosing one of the most important leagues in the world, the Premier League, as it not only brings together highly talented players but also features a promotion and relegation system that motivates all teams to strive to be part of the select group of the best teams in English football.\nThis project aims to analyze the evolution of the most representative aspects of the English league over the years, in terms of attack and defense. Our hypothesis is that the English football has become more competitive. We will examine this through key match indicatores including goals scored, shots on target, league standings, home versus away performance, refereeing decisions, and card intensity across Premier League matches.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis project uses publicly available match-level data provided by Football-Data.co.uk, a long-standing repository of standardized football results and match statistics. The platform compiles official match information from multiple reputable sources—including XScores, BBC Sport, Flashscore, and ESPN—and distributes them in a consistent, computer-ready CSV format suitable for statistical analysis.\nFor the purposes of this study, only data from English football competitions were used. These include the Premier League (Tier 1), Championship (Tier 2), League One (Tier 3) and League Two (Tier4). The dataset covers more than two decades of competitive play, with full-time and half-time results available back to the 1993/94 season and detailed match statistics widely available from the 2000/01 season onward.\nThe variables utilized in this project relate exclusively to match outcomes and in-game performance metrics. These include goals scored, half-time results, shots, shots on target, corners, fouls, disciplinary actions, and referee information. Historical bookmaker odds—also included in the original files—were intentionally excluded, as the analysis focuses on sporting performance rather than betting markets.\nFootball-Data.co.uk aggregates information from multiple official and media-based match reporting services to ensure accuracy and completeness. Data are updated on a rolling basis throughout each season and are archived annually, enabling consistent longitudinal analysis across leagues and time periods.\nThis dataset provides a comprehensive, standardized foundation for evaluating long-term trends in English football, comparing performance across divisions, and studying changes in the nature of the game over time.",

In this time-series analysis we evaluated the “End of Season Madness” hypothesis—the theory that goalscoring rates increase significantly in the final months of the campaign due to high stakes (title chases/relegation battles) or fatigue.\nThe 2019/2020 season (blue line) illustrates the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic schedule. It is the only season with data extending into June and July, where scoring rates remained high (~3.0 goals), suggesting that the break in play did not negatively impact attacking output.\n\n\nCode\n# Alluvial of the standigns of each league over the last years.\n\ntarget_season &lt;- \"2024/2025\"\n\nprem_season &lt;- premier_full_complete |&gt;\n  filter(Season == target_season)\n\nprem_season &lt;- prem_season |&gt;\n  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))\n\nresults_long &lt;- bind_rows(prem_season |&gt;\n  transmute(Date, Team = HomeTeam, Opp  = AwayTeam, GF   = FTHG, GA   = FTAG), prem_season |&gt;\n  transmute(Date, Team = AwayTeam, Opp  = HomeTeam, GF   = FTAG, GA   = FTHG)) |&gt;\n  arrange(Date, Team) |&gt;\n  mutate(Points = case_when(GF &gt; GA ~ 3L, GF == GA ~ 1L, TRUE    ~ 0L), GD = GF - GA)\n\nresults_cum &lt;- results_long |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  arrange(Date, .by_group = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(game_number = row_number(), cum_pts     = cumsum(Points), cum_gd      = cumsum(GD), cum_gf      = cumsum(GF)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# Ranking after each game week\nstandings_by_round &lt;- results_cum |&gt;\n  group_by(game_number) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(cum_pts), desc(cum_gd), desc(cum_gf), Team, .by_group = TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(Position = row_number()) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nmax_round &lt;- max(standings_by_round$game_number, na.rm = TRUE)\ncuts &lt;- sort(unique(c(1, seq(3, max_round, by = 3), max_round)))\n\nalluvial_df &lt;- standings_by_round |&gt;\n  filter(game_number %in% cuts) |&gt;\n  mutate(Matchday  = factor(game_number, levels = cuts), PosFactor = factor(Position, levels = 1:20))\n\nggplot(alluvial_df, aes(x = Matchday, stratum  = PosFactor, alluvium = Team, y= 1, fill     = Team)) +\n  geom_flow(stat= \"alluvium\", lode.guidance = \"frontback\", alpha= 0.65) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 0.25, color = \"grey30\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"alluvium\", data = dplyr::filter(alluvial_df, \n                                                    Matchday ==levels(Matchday)[length(levels(Matchday))]), \n            aes(label = Team), size = 3, color= \"black\", \n            hjust     = -0.05, position  = position_nudge(x = 0.2)) +\n  stat_stratum(geom  = \"text\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)),size  = 3,color = \"black\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.02, 0.20))) +\n  labs(title    = \"Team Positions Over the Season (Alluvial)\", \n       subtitle = paste(\"Premier League\", target_season, \"— positions shown every 5 matchdays\"), \n       x = \"Matchday\", y = \"Position\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  theme_football() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor   = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premier League is considered an extremely competitive league due to its more equitable distribution of broadcasting revenue, the quality of signings, and the high athletic level of the players. Nevertheless, if we look at last season´s table, we can identify three types of teams: those that fight for the top positions, those that remain in the middle of the table, and those that struggle to avoid finishing last. The first ten matches of the 2024/2025 season were not definite to predict how the teams would end the season were not enough to predict how the teams would finish; after the tenth match, the die was pretty much cast, and the battle unfolded within each of these three groups.",

Of the twenty teams that played in the Premier League twenty-five years ago, only ten remain in the league for the 2023-2024 season. Among them, there are teams like Arsenal, Liverpool, and Chelsea, which have maintained a relatively similar position from 2000 to today; teams like Aston Villa and Tottenham, which climbed in the standings over the years, moving from the eighth and twelfth to fourth and ninth, respectively; and teams that have changed dramatically, such as Manchester United, which held first place in 2000-2001 and is now in eighth, or Manchester City, which was in eighteenth place in 2000-2001 and is now in first place.\n\n\nCode\n# Teams in the season 2023/2024: where were they in the season 2000-2001?\n\nteams_last_season &lt;- standings_final |&gt;\n  filter(Season == \"2024/2025\") |&gt; \n  pull(Team)\n\nstandings_last &lt;- standings_final |&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% teams_last_season) |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = factor(Season, levels = seasons_sel), PosFactor = factor(Position, levels = 20:1))\n\nggplot(standings_last,\n  aes(x = Season,stratum  = PosFactor,alluvium = Team,\n      y        = 1,\n      fill     = Team)) +\n  geom_flow(stat = \"alluvium\",lode.guidance = \"frontback\",alpha = 0.65) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 0.25, color = \"grey30\") +\n  stat_stratum(geom = \"text\",aes(label = after_stat(stratum)),\n               size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"alluvium\",\n    data = standings_last |&gt; filter(Season == seasons_sel[length(seasons_sel)]),\n    aes(label = Team),\n    size = 3, color = \"black\", hjust = -0.05, \n    position = position_nudge(x = 0.2)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.02, 0.20))) +\n  scale_y_reverse(breaks = NULL) +\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Evolution of 2024/2025 Teams\",\n    subtitle = \"Premier League — Where did today's teams come from?\",\n    x        = \"Season\", y        = NULL\n  ) + theme_football()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we analyze the teams in the current season and compare their historical positions, we can confirm the behavior observed in the previous plot. We also we see that all the teams ranked from tenth place downward were not competing in the Premier League twenty-five years ago. Most of them were already in the league five years ago, but some were not consistently present before and have only recently been promoted to the Premier League, such as Bournemouth, Brentford, Nottingham Forest, and Luton.\nThis is a positive sign the league’s competitiveness as it indicates that newly promoted teams can enter the Premier League and compete with the top clubs.",

This behavior can be related to better playing techniques and to a stricter strategies from referees. When looking at yellow cards over the same period, we observe a constant trend from 2000 to 2020. This suggests that, even though fouls decreased, referees continued issuing yellow cards at similar rates, which is evidence of a stricter interpretation of the rules. This aligns with the fact that the regulations have become stronger and penalize more unsporting conducts. Red cards, meanwhile, have historically been rare events in matches. Although they appear to decrease slightly, they remain at consistently low levels.\n\n\nCode\ncards_result_band &lt;- premier_full_complete |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    total_cards = HY + AY + HR + AR,\n    card_band = case_when(\n      total_cards &lt;= 1 ~ \"0–1 cards\",\n      total_cards &lt;= 3 ~ \"2–3 cards\",\n      total_cards &lt;= 5 ~ \"4–5 cards\",\n      TRUE            ~ \"6+ cards\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(FTR), !is.na(card_band)) |&gt;\n  group_by(card_band, FTR) |&gt;\n  summarise(n = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(card_band) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\ncards_result_band &lt;- cards_result_band |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    FTR = factor(FTR, levels = c(\"H\", \"D\", \"A\"))\n  )\n\nggplot(cards_result_band,\n       aes(x = FTR, y = card_band, fill = prop)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = percent(prop, accuracy = 1)),\n            color = \"black\", size = 3) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n  colours = c(\"#f7fbff\", \"#c6dbef\", \"#6baed6\", \"#08519c\"),\n  limits  = c(0, 1),                \n  breaks  = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),\n  labels  = scales::percent,\n  name    = \"Proportion of matches\"\n) +\n\n  labs(\n    title    = \"Match Result vs. Card Intensity — Premier League\",\n    subtitle = \"Rows: total cards in the match (yellow + red)\",\n    x        = \"Full-time result (FTR)\",\n    y        = \"Card intensity band\"\n  ) + theme_football()+\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the joint distribution between card intensity and full-time result of a match. For all levels of card intensity, most matches are won by the home team. Nevertheless, this home advantage decreases as card intensity rises: home wins drop from 52% in low-card matches (0-1 cards) to 44% in high-card matches (6+ cards). On the other hand, away wins remain practically constant at 28% across all bands, suggesting that this result is not affected by card intensity. Draws also increase along with card intensity, rising from 20% to 28%.",
